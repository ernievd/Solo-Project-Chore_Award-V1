# Chore Award

Chore Award is a full stack web application that tracks childrens chores and other activities as tasks and
awards points for the completion of the tasks. Children and parents agree on an item that the child wants to earn points
 toward, the parent assigns a point value to the item and once the predetermined amount of award points has been earned 
 through the completion of tasks the parent is alerted and can then buy them the item as an award. 
 Chore awards main goal is to help motivate children towards performing and finishing chores without the parent 
 having to constantly remind them.
